		Review:
			"Disclosure's  Settle is an electrifying masterpiece that seamlessly blends house, garage, and pop elements, creating a sonic experience that feels both nostalgic and groundbreaking. From the infectious beats of  Latch  to the soulful vocals on White Noise, each track is a journey in itself The duo's production prowess shines through, with tight rhythms, catchy hooks, and a keen sense of melody F For You and When a Fire Starts to Burn showcase their ability to craft club anthems that still resonate with depth The collaboration with talented vocalists adds another layer, elevating the album to a truly immersive experience...",
